AI-powered Video Editing Assistant (refined concept):
Name: Video Genie - Implies effortless video creation and magic-like results.
Value proposition: Save creators 50% of editing time with automated tasks, smart templates, AI-powered music and effects selection, and one-click video optimization for different platforms.
Target market: Content creators, social media influencers, small businesses.
Financial projections:
* Freemium model: Free for basic features, Pro ($9.99/month) for advanced features and unlimited exports.
* Projected revenue: 1 million users in year 1, $12 million annual revenue, 30% year-on-year growth.
Features:
Automated Tasks:
* Cropping:
    * Use a pre-trained scene detection model with custom trigger options for manual selection and scene transitions.
    * This allows dynamic cropping based on the changing scene content.
* Trimming:
    * Explore models like Auris.ai's "Video Trimming" or integrate fade detection with scene detection.
    * This enables precise trimming based on scene changes and audio cues.
* Basic Color Correction:
    * Utilize pre-built functions for brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments.
    * Consider SceneFormer for scene-specific adjustments based on content analysis.
Music Selection:
* Text-to-Speech and Audio Generation:
    * For basic needs, use a platform like Fakeyou.com.
    * Explore options like Jukebox from OpenAI for more diverse and controllable musical styles.
* Mood-based Suggestions:
    * Integrate pre-trained models like "AudioTag" or "EmoMusic" for mood detection and suggesting appropriate music tracks.
    * Consider Hugging Face models for wider music selection.
* Real-time Suggestions:
    * Integrate the chosen model's API into the editing interface for dynamic music recommendations based on video content and user preferences.
Subtitles:
* Speech Recognition and Subtitle Generation:
    * Consider using Whisper from OpenAI for accurate speech recognition.
    * Integrate subtitle editing and synchronization tools for polishing and customizing subtitles.
    * Choose a model trained on real-world conversational speech for better accuracy.
Scene Analysis:
* Scene Detection:
    * Start with a pre-trained scene detection model.
    * For more robust scene understanding and content categorization, explore models like C3D.
Smart Templates:
* Integrate scene analysis models with a no-code app builder to automatically suggest relevant templates based on video content, genre, or platform.
Additional Considerations:
* Target Users: Prioritize ease of use and intuitive interfaces for beginners. Offer advanced customization options and AI suggestion control for professionals.
* Performance Needs: Balance processing speed with accuracy and model complexity. Consider cloud-based solutions for demanding tasks.
* Open-source vs. Proprietary: Choose models based on your needs and resources. Open-source offers transparency and customization, while proprietary models may have better performance and support.
